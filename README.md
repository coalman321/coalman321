Hi, My name is Cole Tucker 
<br>(@coalman321 on github)
</p>


I am a Masters Student in Robotics and Control Systems design at the Ohio State University. I graduated with my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at Ohio State in May 2022. I am also the Software Team lead for Ohio State Underwater Robotics for the 2022 - 2023 season. You can check out our work on ![github](https://github.com/osu-uwrt) or on our ![team website](https://org.osu.edu/osu-uwrt/) ! 

## FRC and Early Robotics
I have been working in the robotics space, starting as a student on FRC team 4145. I also had robotic systems for the International Science and Engineering Fair in 2016 and 2017. Heres a demo video!

From there, It was onwards and upwards. In 2018, I helped lead FRC 4145 to our first regional win as the alliance captain at buckeye regional in part by building our programming team from nothing into a team capable of developing real-time path planning systems. After our sucess in 2018, I continued to mentor the tem from 2019 through 2022. During this time the team won two Innovation in control awards for their real time path planning algorithm in 2019, and in 2022, the

on an FRC robot.

## Capstone Team
In the 2021 - 2022 school year, I also worked on a robotic system for my capstone project. The goal of the system was to serve as an automatic football throwing machine that could track and throw to a human player! Heres another cool demo of the project in action!

I was responsible for the development of the software as well as the mechanical design of the system which had to carry 26 pounds during operation (largely due to the wheels). The code I developed in C++ and python using the ROS2 stack is located under our captsone teams 
![github organization](https://github.com/rCapstoneBets).

## Ohio State Underwater Robotics
Last year, I was also had a leading role in developing our Riptide Vehicle software stack in ROS2. It was the first Vehicle to compete in the international competition called ![RoboSub]( https://robosub.org/programs/2022 ) using ROS2. Our sub won 10th in autonomy (we certaily learned a few lessons about maintainability) and we also took home 3rd place for our documentation which I also helped create! This year I am heading the software team and driving developments in our user experience, simulation, control, and overall documentation of the systems onboard our robot.
